    My name is Alina and I’m 16 years old.
    I am in 10th grade at Jenaplanschule in
    Jena. Short films fascinate me because
    they are so versatile and convertible.
    You can express a lot and reach out to
    many people. These are some of the
    reasons why you can find me anywhere
    with a camera in my hands.
