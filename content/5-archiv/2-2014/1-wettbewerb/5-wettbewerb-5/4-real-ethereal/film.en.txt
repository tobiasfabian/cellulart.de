Text: Composed of stop-motion animations, After Effects compositions and environmental installations, Real Ethereal is a journey that transforms everyday physical matter into a phantasmagoric experience. Mann explores themes of genesis, biology, life, and death by utilizing cotton balls, q-tips, trash bags, shaving cream and other familiar materials, which become re-contextulized and thus transcend their “normal” function. The real becomes ethereal.
