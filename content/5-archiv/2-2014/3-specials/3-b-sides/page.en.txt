    We only have five programmes for our competition – but significantly more outstanding films. What to do about it? For the fourth time now we answer this question with our “b-sides”.
    
    Be it trees that become friends, bizarre split-screen-film-noir or quirky Ernst-Jandl screen adaptations – we’re getting into the thick of things far away from mainstream.
