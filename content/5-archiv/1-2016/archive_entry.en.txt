What to expect at the International Short Film Festival Jena ? From 19th to 24th April 2017, we will be presenting top-notch short films of all genres and categories by filmmakers from all over the world at Volksbad Jena. We will make you laugh, cry, dance and reflect.

Get to know directors and producers! And the best thing: You decide who is going to win. Alongside the awards presented by our professional jury, the audience can vote for their favorite short to receive the audience award. If you’re interested in Finland, come and join us at this year’s country focus programme . We're gonna kick off the festival week with our popular open-air event at Johannistor. The crowning finish will be the award ceremony on Saturday evening. Afterwards, you can get your groove on at the after show party. Welcome!
