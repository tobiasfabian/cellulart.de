    My name is Anna-Maria Görnandt and I am
    in the 10th grade of the Freie
    Waldorfschule Jena. Two of my favourite
    hobbies are Hip Hop Dance and
    Photography. I like taking pictures of
    moments, because you can evoke emotions
    and passion with a photograph. The
    impact of films is impressive to me. I
    myself like to experiment with the art
    of film in order to learn it.

    My name is Luise Krahnert and I am 17
    years old. I am in the 11th grade of the
    Christliches Gymnasium Jena, where I
    have been taking classes in
    “Presentation and Design” for two
    and a half years. During this course, we
    have also been creating our own little
    film. I also manage the study group
    “Young Authors.” Short films
    fascinate me because of the succinct
    narratives, which are short yet
    exciting; they can be funny or shocking.

    Hello, I am Pauline. I am 16 years old
    and a student of the Freie Waldorfschule
    Jena. In my free time I like to do
    sports. I dance and do artistry. I like
    watching good movies. What I find
    fascinating about short movies is, how
    film makers accomplish telling a story
    with all its emotions and details in
    such a short time.
