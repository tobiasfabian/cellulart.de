    The Volksbad in Jena has a rich past. It was built between 1907 and 1909, and advanced quickly with its saunas, swimming pools and medical spa therapies to a central meeting point for cultural exchange in Jena. Post-millennial, the protected building was shut down temporarily.  A renovation made it possible to continue the building’s long tradition. Since 2007, the Volksbad is a popular and well-attended venue. 2016, the cellu l’art short film festival is taking place for the fourth time in the history-charged location Volksbad.
