Text: In the ghettos of Warsaw 1942. Samek, an-8-year-old boy, cheeky and full of live, peeks through a hole in the Ghetto Wall and sees a carrot on the other side of the sidewalk. With help of a piece of wire he tries to get the carrot to his side, not knowing that closely positioned SS-men are watching his every move closely.
