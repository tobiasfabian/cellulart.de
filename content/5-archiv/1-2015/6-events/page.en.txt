  text: |
    The festival season starts with an open-air cinema. We will traditionally celebrate the short film at Faulloch. The Indie-Rock-Band „The Illustrators” will provide for musical entertainment from 8 pm on. The four boys convey a unique dynamic sound with their mix out of indie-rock and electronical, which will tickle your feet.
    
    At 9:30 pm the short films will be brought onto the big screen. The highlights of the last festivals, seasoned with current short films make you want more.
    From funny and dramatic to heartbreaking and bizarre, you will find everything. And we will also provide food and beverages for your dining pleasure. The best part: The admission is free.
