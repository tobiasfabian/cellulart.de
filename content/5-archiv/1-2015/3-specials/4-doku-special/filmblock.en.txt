Text: 

More exciting than fiction is only the reality. To capture the small and big stories of the world has always been the task for some people. These international short documentaries from the last ten years lead us to unknown places and introduce us to unusual people from all over the world. We will meet very special animals and look behind the curtains of hidden worlds. Rejoice with us on the everyday madness and exceptional banalities.
