Course of studies: Bachelor of German Literature, Linguistics

I visited the student introduction days and listened to Susi's enthusiastic stories about short film festivals. Then, I went to one of the weekly sessions, experienced my first exciting short film evening and a bunch of short film buffs. By now I have finished half of my studies by now. I'm still working with cellu l'art and I'm sure that I'm gonna continue with that until the end of my studies.

A good short film ... has to move me, either positively or negatively.
