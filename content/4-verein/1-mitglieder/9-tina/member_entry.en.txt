It only took visiting the festival one time to get enthused about the work of cellu lâ€™art. The special thing for me: Even without any experience I was welcomed and can get first glimpses into the organization of a film festival. Obviously it is a lot of fun to work with this team and they always offer support when needed.

A good short film hast to make its point quickly and to fully take my attention.
