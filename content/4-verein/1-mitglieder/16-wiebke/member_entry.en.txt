Course of studies: Master of Art History and Film Studies

I joined the festival team during my second week in Jena. I immediately became part of the work group preparing the Turkish country focus and was elected as the vice chairwoman the following year. One year later, I took over the position as chairwoman. What can I say - cellu l'art is all about the magic of the moment, about amazing films and a wonderful team of film buffs!

A good short film ... doesn't have to do anything but CAN do everything! It doesn't always take two and a half hours to tell a life story, sometimes five minutes is just enough.
