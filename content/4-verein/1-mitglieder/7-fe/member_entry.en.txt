I joined cellu l’art just one month after I had moved to Jena in April of 2015. I was watching a competition programme and became interested in becoming part of the team. After the award ceremony, I was welcomed with open arms and just a short while later, I got the opportunity to being in charge of the Finnish country focus programme at the 17th cellu l'art Short Film Festival.

A good short film ... doesn’t have to do anything - though it can.
