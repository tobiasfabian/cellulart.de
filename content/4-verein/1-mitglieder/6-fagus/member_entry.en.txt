Occupation: Media scientist

We made something out of nothing and all of our commitment makes big cinema out of that something. We make cinema and thatâ€™s a lot of emotion for all of us.

A good short film ... means the artful skill to create ten minutes of enthralling entertainment full of depth, wit and charm.
