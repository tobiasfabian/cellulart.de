Very rarely people are so welcoming the way they are at cellu l’art. After a short time I was already organizing my first film evening and could experience my first festival. Now that I’m on the board I have a bit more responsibility and am excited what a great team can achieve. Fantastic!

A good short film has to do things within minutes, a normal length film has hours to do: to tell a story that is moving!
