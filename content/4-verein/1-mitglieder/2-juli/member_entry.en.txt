It's rare that people are so welcoming the way they are at cellu l’art. After just a short time, I was already organizing my first film evening and was able to experience my first festival edition. Now that I’m on the board I have some more responsibilities and I'm excited to see what such a great team is able to achieve. Awesome!

A good short film ... has to do something a feature-length film has hours to do within just a few minutes: to tell a moving story!
