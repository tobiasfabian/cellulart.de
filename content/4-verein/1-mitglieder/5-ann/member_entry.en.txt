The spirit and commitment of enthusiastic short film lovers made me an active member of cellu lâ€™art and to organize a film evening. I especially like the country focus of the festival. I am pleased to help out with the organization and the programme for the upcoming country focus.

A good short film needs to have a good suspense.
