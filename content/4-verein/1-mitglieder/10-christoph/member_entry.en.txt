Why am I at cellu l'art? Funny story actually: I was sitting, completely clueless (so totally normal) in a required course of Latin when my lecturer asked me at the end if I wanted to organise a short film festival… No, but seriously: Once you’ve done it, it’s like a drug! 

A good short film has to have IT and definitely belongs (back) in cinemas.
