Occupation: Art historian

I've been a movie buff for quite a long time, and after I had finished my art history and film studies in Jena, I came across cellu l'art. I wanted to organize something, do some networking and engage myself in film as an art form. Also, it's a plus to see those glowing eyes of guests and filmmakers!

A good short film ... has got to have someone who watches it.
