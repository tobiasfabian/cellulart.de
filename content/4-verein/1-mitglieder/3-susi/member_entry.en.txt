A friend and colleague of mine had a good sense of my interests and persuaded me to go to a weekly session of the association. I think it’s fantastic to create something so great, valuable and exciting with such a diverse group. If you’ve done it once, you’re in for it.

A good short film has to be like a rollercoaster ride: You’re lifting up slowly and during the descend you’re experiencing a mixture of all kinds of different emotions and when it’s all over – you want to do it all over again.
