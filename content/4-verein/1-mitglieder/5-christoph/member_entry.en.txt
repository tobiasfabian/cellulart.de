Occupation: (Radio) Journalist

Why am I at cellu l'art? It's actually a funny story: I was sitting in a seminar (as a completely clueless freshman) when my lecturer asked me if I wanted to organise a short film festival ... And in all seriousness: Once you've started, it's like a drug!

A good short film ... has to have IT and definitely belongs (back) into movie theatres.
