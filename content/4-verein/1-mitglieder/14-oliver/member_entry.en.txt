Short films create a wonderous fascination that makes you want to watch the next one immediately: Maybe it's gonna be your new favorite film and if it's not ... maybe the next one will be? It's quite similar to working at cellu l'art: Once you've started, you don't ever wanna stop.

A good short film ... has to leave me in awe, so much so that I wanna show it to others to observe their reactions!
