Last year I attended my first film festival – now I am managing one. Film festivals are a rollercoaster of emotions. I’ve never seen so many amazing films and met the people behind them! What I appreciate the most is the atmosphere that everyone shares – the guests, the filmmakers and the team.

A good short film has to grab my attention, make me think and then never let me go.
