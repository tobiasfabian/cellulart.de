Film festivals are a rollercoaster of emotions. Never before have I seen so many amazing films and met the people behind them! What I appreciate the most is the atmosphere that everyone creates together - the guests, the filmmakers and the team.

A good short film ... has to grab my attention, make me think and then never let me go again.
