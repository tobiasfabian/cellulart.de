It's a wrap - and we've had a blast at this year's award ceremony. The cinema hall of the Volksbad was filled with guests waiting to hear the results of the jury and eager to watch the awarded films. It definitely wasn't an easy task for the jury to make their choices, but in the end they could confidently honour films that moved us and got stuck in our minds.

These are the awarded short films: 

Teen Shorts Award, sponsored by Jena Bioscience: "9 Meter" by Anders Walter

Award of the Youth Jury: "Leona" by Davek Carrizosa
Special Mention: "We Can't Live Without Cosmos" by Konstantin Bronzit

Jena Film Award for Tolerance, sponsored by mayor Dr. Albrecht Schröter: "My Enemy, My Brother" von Ann Shin

Best ExAnDo (Experimental, Animation & Documentary): "We Can't Live Without Cosmos" by Konstantin Bronzit
Special Mention: "Load" by Nic Shpigel and Robert Moreno

Best Film: "Czułość - Tenderness" by Emilia Zielonka
Special Mention: "90 Grad Nord" by Detsky Graffam

Audience Award: "Discipline" by Christophe M. Saber

A big thank-you to everyone who has helped making this a wonderful and memorable festival week. Thanks to all supporters, sponsors, filmmakers, friends, the cellu l'art team and of course a special thanks goes out to our great audience!
