With thundering applause and a shower of confetti we are presenting our new website. We are rolling out a new design entering our 17th festival season and after a long remodeling, you are finally able to check out our new look. Although it is a while until April 2016, it will not be a boring time in the short film scene of Jena. You should expect numerous short film nights throughout the next several months. 

For anyone who is interested, on October, 17th 2015, we will host a short teatime and speed-dating event in order to get to know the wonderful people working to put on this film festival. In addition, we encourage discussing our focus on Ireland while enjoying a nice cold beer. This will take place at the international centrum Haus auf der Mauer. Wide awake we are having our second “A Bar Is A Screen” Night on November 2nd, where we are not only bar-hopping but also walking through the international world of short film. 

Come on over and enjoy it with us!
