Everyone is driving home for Christmas to spend some nice, calm days among family. But the complaints don’t wait for long: the holidays are not long enough, not enough time with friends at home und basically the year is too short anyway. We want to celebrate having not a lot of time with you: on 21st Dec, the shortest day of the year. And what seems more fitting than short films?

AG Kurzfilm calls for a nationwide short-film-day and cellu l’art is participating. “(link: https://www.facebook.com/events/525381764293661/ text: Who has the shortest?! popup: true)” – come to Café Wagner and watch a colourful mix of exciting, funny and also serious films with us that especially involve one thing: Bare skin.

Much better than a conversation with your granny who as per usual wants to know how you’re doing at university!
