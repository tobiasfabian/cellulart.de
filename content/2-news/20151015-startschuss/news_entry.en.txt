That was the 16th Cellu l’art International Short film festival. The old one is in the past and the new one…just started! On this weekend we’ll commence the new festival season with a drum roll. On the occasion of the (link: http://www.irischetage.de/ text: Irish Days popup: true), we’ll once again take you to the breathtaking cultural landscape of Ireland on Saturday evening from 8 pm in the Haus auf der Mauer. The theme of the evening – love – is just as multifaceted as the short films of the green island. Whether dramatic live action or puppet shows, we’ve got something to offer for everyone.

Anyone who wants to participate and not just watch is invited to come for coffee and cake at 4 pm.  You want to discover international short films and to shape the festival yourself or meet the film makers? The Speed Date is just the thing for you! Get to know the Cellu l’art-creators and the association work and after that we’ll enjoy the film night together.

That went to fast for you? Just browse through our event calendar on the right hand side or visit our facebook-page.

We’re looking forward seeing you there.
