Title: Got a spare room for a filmmaker?

----

Text: 

cellu l'art Short Film Festival is almost around the corner and we're eagerly awaiting international guests who want to present their films to the public in Jena. They gotta sleep somewhere though, don't they? Of course they do! That's why we're looking for friendly, helpful people who'd like to welcome the arriving filmmakers into their homes.

So, if you got a spare room and you'd like to meet nice, creative people, let us know by writing an e-mail to <guests@cellulart.de>! That's not all though: For your cooperation, you will be rewarded with a ticket to a film programme of your choice. The complete schedule will be online on our website in the beginning of April. See you soon!
