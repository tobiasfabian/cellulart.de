While St. Nicolaus comes over today to put some candy in children’s boots, Finland raises its blue-white flag as the country in nothern Europe is celebrating its independence. For many centuries, the territory of Finland was part of the Swedish Empire until it became an autonomous part of the Russian Empire as a grand duchy in 1809. On December 6th, 1917 the Finnish parliament finally declared the independence of Finland. Which also means that Finland will celebrate a whole century as an independent state in 2017!

However, before that, Finland's coming to Jena – as the focus country of the 17th cellu l’art Short Film Festival (19th-24th April 2016).
