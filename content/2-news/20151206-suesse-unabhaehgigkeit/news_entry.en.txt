While we are having St. Nicolaus come over today and putting sweets in children’s boots, Finland raises its blue-white flag, because the land in the north of Europe is celebrating its independence. For many centuries the territory of Finland was part of the Swedish Empire until it became an autonomous part of the Russian Empire as a grand duchy in 1809. On 6th Dec 1917 the Finnish parliament finally declared the independence of Finland. That also means that Finland will celebrate a century as an independent state in 2017.

Before that is happening the „land of the thousand lakes“  is a guest in Jena – as the focus country of the 17th cellu l’art short film festival (19.-24-04.2016). For everyone who wants to get in the mood already can check out the “adventcalendar” on (link: http://xmas.finland.fi/06-peacemaker/ text: thisisFINLAND popup: true) or their (link: https://www.facebook.com/thisisfinlandFB/?fref=ts text: facebook page popup: true): Every day a new emoji illustrates emotions, strengths and vices of the Fins. 

Happy Independence Day, Finland! Or in Finnish: Hyvää itsenäisyyspäivää, Suomi!
