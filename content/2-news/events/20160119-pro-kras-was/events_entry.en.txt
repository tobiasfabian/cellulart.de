Procrastination: the action of delaying or postponing something. In times of crowded to-do-lists, exams and stress you should take a moment to relax. Instead of staring at the wall in front of your desk you can simply procrastinate with us. Allow yourself a crazy night and get lost into insanity and mindfuck of the world of short film.
